## About The Project

This project was created as a learning exercise to build a modern and elegant login interface. The main goal was to practice and demonstrate proficiency in creating responsive web designs using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox.

The form includes standard email and password fields, along with a JavaScript-powered icon that allows users to toggle the visibility of their password.

## Key Features

- **Modern & Elegant UI:** A clean and visually appealing design suitable for modern web applications.
- **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) thanks to Flexbox.
- **Password Visibility Toggle:** An icon next to the password field allows users to show or hide the password they are typing, improving user experience.
- **Lightweight Code:** Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the page.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
    - **Flexbox:** Used extensively for creating a flexible and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** To implement the interactive password visibility toggle functionality.

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of several key front-end concepts:

- **Advanced Flexbox:** Gained hands-on experience in using Flexbox to build complex, responsive layouts that work across various devices.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Learned how to use JavaScript to select and manipulate HTML elements to create interactive features like the password toggle.
- **Responsive Design Principles:** Practiced using media queries to ensure a consistent user experience on all screen sizes.
